An Americano is a popular coffee beverage made by diluting a shot of espresso with hot water. This combination results in a drink that has a similar strength to traditionally brewed coffee but retains the distinctive flavor of espresso. The ratio of espresso to water can be adjusted according to personal preference, and it can be enjoyed black or with milk and sugar.
